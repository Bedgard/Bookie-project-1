## Project Introduction

Bookie is a clean, modern, and fully responsive online bookstore website designed with a mobile-first approach.  
The goal of this project is to create a visually appealing, user-friendly platform that showcases books efficiently across all devices — from smartphones to desktops.

Built entirely with semantic HTML5 and CSS3, this project demonstrates how CSS alone can handle layout, styling, and interactivity without any JavaScript.

This project highlights clean, maintainable code, smooth CSS transitions, and a focus on accessibility and responsive design best practices.

## Features

### • Responsive Layout  
Mobile-first design with flexible grid and layout adaptations for tablets and desktops.

### • Pure CSS Interactive Elements  
Interactive filtering and navigation toggles implemented solely with CSS techniques (checkbox hacks and transitions).

### • Semantic HTML5 Structure  
Well-structured HTML with proper semantic tags for accessibility and SEO.

### • Smooth CSS Transitions and Animations  
Hover effects, fades, and toggles created with CSS keyframes and transitions.

### • No JavaScript  
All interactivity is achieved using only HTML and CSS, with no scripts required.
